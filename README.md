Odin Recipe Project

This project is a website where I show recipes I've found online and link to them from the homepage.

Skills Demonstrated:
- Gained practice typing out the HTML boilerplate
- Learned how to use relative links to link back and forth between pages.
- Learned how to link images, add a descriptive alt tag and change the size of the image using HTML.
- Used the project to help use unordered and ordered lists more often to gain further understanding of how and when to use them.
- Practised using header sizes correctly.
